=================================

A d3 frontend for displaying data about SF's lobby info

Required:
To use this frontend, you also need an API backend. There are two options:
 * You can also run a local version of [let's all go to the lobby](https://github.com/hobinjk/lets-all-go-to-the-lobby) on port 3000.
 * You can point d3 to: http://jk.xvm.mit.edu:3000/


Then run this locally with

``python -m SimpleServer 4000``
